## Potential passive unlocks:
- Precision Drop - unit will land closer to the center of the targeted area
- Black Ops - if none of the deployed are visible to any enemy unit after Dynamic Deployment, all deployed units enter concealment.

add some code to break the concealment when deploying SPARK-like units, unless they specifically purchase a sound dampening upgrade

# Universal:
- If this unit normally starts mission in concealment, they will enter concealment upon deployment.
- Smoke Screen - apply a cloud of smoke around the deployment area upon deployment.
- Enter Overwatch upon landing.
- Guns Blazing - attacks do not end turn during the deployment turn.
- Unit gains Overdrive effect upon deployment.
- randomize landing location more, but add an upgrade to make it more precise
